    "Use of Multimedia in Distance Education",
    "The advent of multimedia has revolutionized distance education, bridging the gap between educators and learners separated by geographical boundaries. Multimedia, encompassing text, audio, video, graphics, animations, and interactive tools, has enhanced the accessibility, engagement, and efficacy of distance learning. This research paper delves into the transformative role of multimedia in distance education, emphasizing its benefits, challenges, and future potential. Distance education has evolved from correspondence courses to sophisticated digital platforms leveraging multimedia technologies. These technologies facilitate dynamic and interactive learning environments that cater to diverse learner needs. Mayer's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning underscores the psychological basis for integrating multimedia, suggesting that well-designed multimedia content can improve comprehension and retention. Tools such as virtual labs, video lectures, and gamified learning platforms have made education more engaging and accessible, especially in fields like STEM, arts, and professional training. While the advantages are significant, challenges persist. The digital divide and technological barriers hinder equitable access, especially in remote or underprivileged regions. Additionally, creating high-quality multimedia content often requires substantial resources and expertise. Case studies of platforms like Coursera, edX, and Open University highlight successful applications of multimedia in various educational contexts, demonstrating how thoughtful implementation can overcome these barriers. Looking ahead, emerging technologies like augmented reality, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence promise to further enhance multimedia's role in distance education. However, stakeholders must prioritize inclusivity and accessibility to ensure these advancements benefit all learners. This paper concludes that multimedia is indispensable for modern distance education. It not only enriches the learning experience but also democratizes education, making it more inclusive and effective. Policymakers, educators, and technologists must collaborate to address existing challenges and harness multimedia's full potential to transform the future of learning.",

    "The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has brought significant reforms to teacher education in India, aiming to improve the quality and relevance of teacher preparation. This research paper presents a comparative analysis of NEP 2020 and existing teacher education policies, focusing on implementations for B.Ed colleges. The study examines the key reforms introduced by NEP 2020, including the four-year integrated B.Ed. degree, multidisciplinary approach, experiential learning, and digital literacy. A comparative analysis of NEP 2020 and existing policies reveals significant differences in curriculum, teacher qualifications, and institutional frameworks. The paper highlights the implications of NEP 2020 for B.Ed colleges, including curriculum redesign, faculty development, and infrastructure upgrades. The study concludes that effective implementation of NEP 2020 requires collaborative efforts from policymakers, institutions, and stakeholders to ensure that B.Ed colleges are equipped to produce high-quality teachers who can meet the demands of 21st-century education.",

    "Agricultural Data Security: Safeguarding Digital Agriculture in the Era of Precision Farming and Smart Agriculture",
    "The rapid digital transformation of agriculture has fundamentally redefined agricultural production by integrating precision farming, artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, remote sensing, blockchain, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and data-driven decision support systems into everyday farming operations. While these technological innovations have substantially improved agricultural productivity, sustainability, and resource efficiency, they have simultaneously generated unprecedented cybersecurity challenges. Agricultural data have emerged as strategic digital assets encompassing farm management records, geospatial information, sensor outputs, machinery telemetry, genomic databases, climate intelligence, and supply-chain information. Consequently, cyberattacks targeting agricultural systems now threaten not only data confidentiality but also food security, economic resilience, environmental sustainability, and national security. This article critically examines the concept of agricultural data security within the broader framework of Agriculture 4.0 and smart farming. It analyses the evolving agricultural data ecosystem, identifies major cyber threats confronting precision agriculture, evaluates contemporary technological and governance-based security solutions, and examines emerging policy frameworks governing agricultural data. Drawing upon recent peer-reviewed literature, international standards, and documented cybersecurity incidents affecting the global food and agriculture sector, the article argues that agricultural data security must evolve beyond conventional information security towards an integrated cyber-physical resilience framework. The study concludes that securing agricultural data represents one of the most significant prerequisites for achieving sustainable, resilient, and digitally inclusive agricultural systems in the era of Agriculture 5.0.",

    "Political Thought of M. S. Golwalkar and Its Contribution to the Formation of Modern India",
    "The political thought of Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar (1906–1973), popularly known as Guruji, occupies a significant position in the intellectual history of modern India. As the second Sarsanghchalak of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Golwalkar transformed the organisation into one of the most influential socio-cultural movements in independent India. His writings, particularly We, or Our Nationhood Defined (1939) and Bunch of Thoughts (1966), articulated a conception of India grounded in cultural nationalism, civilisational continuity, and the primacy of Hindu identity. Although Golwalkar never occupied public office, his ideological influence has extended far beyond the RSS, shaping political organisations, public discourse, and debates concerning nationalism, secularism, and national integration. This article examines Golwalkar's political philosophy by analysing his understanding of nationhood, the state, democracy, cultural identity, and social organisation. It further evaluates the contribution of his ideas to the formation of modern India while acknowledging the scholarly criticisms regarding pluralism, minority rights, and constitutional secularism. The article argues that Golwalkar's political thought remains indispensable for understanding the evolution of Hindu nationalism and contemporary Indian politics, irrespective of ideological agreement or disagreement. His intellectual legacy continues to influence debates on national identity, governance, and the relationship between culture and politics in twenty-first-century India.",
